# TranslateIt-Android

**TranslateIt** is an app I developed to make learning English fun and interactive. The app displays a word in English at the center of the screen and four options in Portuguese. The goal is to guess the correct translation to earn points. With well-defined screens and visual feedback (like congratulatory or motivational messages), the app offers a friendly and engaging experience for anyone looking to practice vocabulary.
